# WheelLog-Garmin-ConnectIQ
A Garmin ConnectIQ watch app for WheelLog on Android

Available on the Garmin ConnectIQ store https://apps.garmin.com/en-US/apps/07a231a9-3f2f-4762-b0bb-b8a0b5594f40

For now this watch application requires [my fork](https://github.com/marccardinal/WheelLogAndroid/tree/garmin-connect-iq) of the WheelLogAndroid project available here: 

I opened a [Pull Request](https://github.com/palachzzz/WheelLogAndroid/pull/10) with the project owner on the play store in hopes that he merges it.
